## Overview

_Welcome to the **Pixel Menagerie**, a friendly little site where you can adopt some strange creatures to call your own. Sign up and choose the pets you want, name them, and tell us about their personality! Maybe they've got a weird backstory? It's up to you!_


<br>

## MVP

> The Minimum Viable Product should be a well-planned, easily-communicated product, ensuring that the client's deliverable will be achievable and meet specifications within the time frame estimated.

_The **Project Title** MVP lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus dapibus fermentum risus vitae bibendum. Integer vel ipsum mollis odio sollicitudin ornare eu vel ex. In quis fringilla velit, ac maximus quam. Etiam eget placerat neque. Aenean faucibus sem non nisi lobortis ullamcorper._

### Goals

- _Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet,_
- _consectetur adipiscing elit._
- _Phasellus dapibus fermentum risus vitae bibendum._
- _Integer vel ipsum mollis odio sollicitudin ornare eu vel ex._
- _etc._

#### Component Tree

> Use this section to display the structure of how your React components are being rendered. This should show the parent to child relation between you components. In other words, show which components are rendering the other components. 

#### Component Hierarchy

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like. 

``` structure

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Header.jsx
|__ services/

```

#### Component Breakdown

> Use this section to go into further depth regarding your components, including breaking down the components as stateless or stateful, and considering the passing of data between those components.

|  Component   |    Type    | state | props | Description                                                      |
| :----------: | :--------: | :---: | :---: | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    Header    | functional |   n   |   y   | _The header will contain the navigation and login fields._               |
|  Footer  | functional |   n   |   n   | _The footer includes website credits and contact information._       |
|   Sign Up    |   functional    |   y   |   n   | _The sign-up field will allow users to create an account._      |
| Pet Array | functional |   n   |   y   | _The cards will render the post info via props._                 |
|    Pet List    | functional |   n   |   n   | _The footer will show info about me and a link to my portfolio._ |
| Pet Image | functional | n | y | _The image will be an enlarged version of the selected pet icon._ |
| Pet About | functional | y | n | _The about component will consist of input fields for the user to edit and save._ |
| Button | functional | n | y | _The button will be used for the login, sign up, edit and release buttons._ |

#### Time Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     1 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evaluate possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._

### Server (Back End)

#### ERD Model

> Use this section to display an image of a computer generated ERD model. You can use draw.io, Lucidchart or another ERD tool.

<br>

***

## Post-MVP

> Add one to two line 'descriptions' for the pets. Example; _"You're pretty sure it's a normal cat, but it's hard to tell. Oh well, it probably likes fish anyway."_
> Upon selecting a pet on the adoption page, a card appears with the description and a "take home?" button.
> A starter pet screen appears after you sign up, with three randomly generated pets from the pet-list. 
> A feeding system, with a hunger bar and shop through which to obtain food.
> Add games an a currency system. ( Off-brand duck hunt, maybe? )
